  <h1>About Me</h1>

In addition to my studies, I am passionate about technology and have developed skills as a web developer, a role that allows me to creatively blend technology with practical solutions. This background not only shapes my academic pursuits but also influences my perspective on diverse topics, including gender and communication.<br>
